# Physical Design Project (RTL to GDSII using Fusion Compiler)

This project showcases the complete physical design flow for a 32-bit RISC core using Synopsys Fusion Compiler on a 28nm technology node.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Fusion Compiler (Main tool for synthesis, floorplan, placement, CTS, routing)
- PrimeTime (Timing analysis)
- StarRC (Parasitic extraction)
- TCL Scripting

## 📌 Project Highlights
- Achieved 0 DRC, LVS, and timing violations
- Implemented UPF-based low-power design
- Automated key flow steps
